    abstractnote = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this present era, sentiment analysis is considered as one of the most rapidly growing fields of computer science study. It is a text mining technique which is automated and determines the emotion of a text. A text can be divided into many emotions using sentiment analysis. Since there are some studies on emotion analysis in the Bangla language, it is regarded as a key research area in the field of analyzing Bangla language. This paper works with five different emotions and those are Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise and Excited. Apart from these emotions our paper also deals with two categories, such as Abusive and Religious. We proposed a method of machine learning technique which is the SVM algorithm to extract these five individual emotions from Bangla text.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

Zomato, being the most popular food delivery site and restaurant aggregator provides information, menus, and user reviews of restaurants.

    abstract  = {In this work, we introduce BanglaBERT, a BERT-based Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model pretrained in Bangla, a widely spoken yet low-resource language in the NLP literature. To pretrain BanglaBERT, we collect 27.5 GB of Bangla pretraining data (dubbed {`}Bangla2B+{'}) by crawling 110 popular Bangla sites. We introduce two downstream task datasets on natural language inference and question answering and benchmark on four diverse NLU tasks covering text classification, sequence labeling, and span prediction. In the process, we bring them under the first-ever Bangla Language Understanding Benchmark (BLUB). BanglaBERT achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming multilingual and monolingual models. We are making the models, datasets, and a leaderboard publicly available at \url{https://github.com/csebuetnlp/banglabert} to advance Bangla NLP.}

    abstract       = {With the extensive growth of user interactions through prominent advances of the Web, sentiment analysis has obtained more focus from an academic and a commercial point of view. Recently, sentiment analysis in the Bangla language is progressively being considered as an important task, for which previous approaches have attempted to detect the overall polarity of a Bangla document. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research on the aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) of Bangla text. This can be described as being due to the lack of available datasets for ABSA. In this paper, we provide two publicly available datasets to perform the ABSA task in Bangla. One of the datasets consists of human-annotated user comments on cricket, and the other dataset consists of customer reviews of restaurants. We also describe a baseline approach for the subtask of aspect category extraction to evaluate our datasets.},

    abstract  = {In this paper, we propose an annotated sentiment analysis dataset made of informally written Bangla texts. This dataset comprises public comments on news and videos collected from social media covering 13 different domains, including politics, education, and agriculture. These comments are labeled with one of the polarity labels, namely positive, negative, and neutral. One significant characteristic of the dataset is that each of the comments is noisy in terms of the mix of dialects and grammatical incorrectness. Our experiments to develop a benchmark classification system show that hand-crafted lexical features provide superior performance than neural network and pretrained language models. We have made the dataset and accompanying models presented in this paper publicly available at https://git.io/JuuNB.}
