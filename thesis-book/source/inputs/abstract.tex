With the increasing availability of the internet and mobile devices, more and more people are connecting to social media. Social media has evolved from a simple way of connecting with friends and family to a global village. It now presents itself as a medium of entertainment, a news platform, a marketplace, and a place for advertisement. Users are nowadays attracted by social media content. In this study, we have focused on the food review-related contents of social media and performed sentiment analysis.  During this study, we collected Bangla food reviews and related comments from popular Facebook pages. We have used CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool to collect data from social media pages and used a scoring system based on reactions. Later on, we used Natural Language Processing to classify the collected comments and compared the results to the scoring system. Our study shows a high tendency for positive sentiments in food reviews.
