## Abstract
With the increasing availability of the internet and mobile devices, more and
more people are connecting to social media. Social media has evolved from a simple
way of connecting with friends and family to a global village. It now presents itself
as a medium of entertainment, a news platform, a marketplace, and a place for
advertisement. Users are nowadays attracted by social media content. In this
study, we have focused on the food review-related contents of social media and
performed sentiment analysis. During this study, we collected Bangla food reviews
and related comments from popular Facebook pages. We have used CrowdTangle,
a social media analytics tool to collect data from social media pages and used a
scoring system based on reactions. Later on, we used Natural Language Processing
to classify the collected comments and compared the results to the scoring system.
Our study shows a high tendency for positive sentiments in food reviews
