16-11-18,4:50:38,"1,280",972,102,15,158,26,5,1,0,1,"Few days ago after watching review at FoodBank, we went to have buffet lunch at Four Points by Sheraton Dhaka Gulshan. The food quality was top class and fresh, Environment was nice and cozy. I'd personally give 7.5 out of 10 based on taste of all of their food. But If I compare with the FoodBank's review, then there was a lot of items that was missing like sushi, sausage, shrimps etc. Maybe they prepare different food everyday. And their swimming pool was closed due to maintenance. What really annoying was the price of the water bottle. We had two 250ml of Aquafina water bottle and they charged 75++ on that bottle. Other than that, the price was worth it because they got buy 1 get 1 free (BOGO) offer for several card holders. But before going there, call them to know on which cards do they offer this. But if you don't have cards, then I would strongly recommend you to collect it from your friends or family before going there because without BOGO offer the price will be much higher and will not worth it. One thing I would like to include here is, after making some video clip they said that it's not permissible to shoot video of their food because other customers might feel uneasy. Other than that the behaviour of them was nice and welcoming. You can definitely visit there and have some quality food. So, stay tuned, we will see you in the next vlog.

29-11-18,18:03:00,539,385,32,8,101,12,1,0,0,0,"For the first time Fish & Co. was offering Buffet and we didn‚Äôt wanna miss this chance. YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWmans7FDTU We went there as early as possible so that we could have double round of intaking foods, but the taste was too good that we kept eating and eating. The most important thing was, their food tasted same as their regular menu, which really amazed me. And food was served hot. I liked this buffet most because I could have as much as Calamari as I like and you might know that I‚Äôm a huge fan of their calamari. What I dislike about this buffet most was, they served both Dory Fish & Chicken with the same ‚ÄúPeri-Peri‚Äù sauce. So, they tasted like the same, I would really prefer if they added different spice to cook different items. Below is my ratings on food items: Main Items: *Grilled Calamari with Lemon Butter Sauce - 9.5/10 *Grilled Dory (With Peri Peri Sauce) - 9/10 *Grilled Chicken with Peri Peri Sauce - 9/10 *Mixed vegetables (Was with the dory and chicken) - 8/10 *Pasta with Tomato Sauce - 5/10 *Paella Rice - 7/10 *Chips - 8/10 Desert Item: *Cream Caramel - 7.5/10 Salad Item was with the following Dressings *Honey Balsamic - 6.5/10 *Caesar Dressing - 8/10 *Mint Yoghurt - 8/10 Drinks: *Mango Lemon Juice - 3/10 *Orange Lemon Juice - 2/10 Although they claim this as Juice, but it was actually not. It was more likely ‚ÄúTANG‚Äù sort of thing. But good thing is, they at least offered free drinks which is a huge Plus point on any buffet. They might continue this buffet offer on every Sunday. So, hurry up! I will overall give them 8.5 / 10 compared to price and the quality & quantity. By the way, stay tuned we will see you in the next food and travel Vlog.

17-12-18,5:52:47,495,389,21,7,61,11,2,1,2,1,"Guess what! Our first visit to ‚ÄúThe Pit Grill‚Äù and we were not fully satisfied! *MUST READ after watching the video!!* YouTube Link: https://youtu.be/lulewBAQI6M:=:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lulewBAQI6M&feature=youtu.be We ordered the Rib Eye Steak (Medium Cooked) because on our last vlog (Link: https://youtu.be/9cTla2fXfQ4:=:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cTla2fXfQ4&feature=youtu.be ) we tried the same cut at Woodhouse Grill and wanted to compare the taste between these two restaurants. They served a plate full of crispy chips which were a welcome complimentary item. The chips were nice and crispy seasoned with black paper & tasting sault. I must say this was unique and appetizing. Then the main food came. From the outside, the steak looked yummy! And as a side dish, we took Mashed Potato & Grilled Vegetables. To be frank, I found that the steak itself tasted better than the Woodhouse Grill‚Äôs steak but it lakes sauces. And we also asked for the ‚ÄúMedium Cooked‚Äù but I found that some part of the steak was kind of like ‚ÄúRare Medium‚Äù in cooked. Didn‚Äôt expect it to be that way. Most of the other steakhouses offer one or two complimentary sauce like black pepper sauce or mushroom sauce or pepper sauce etc, but they had no sauces whatsoever. Which was like ‚ÄúWHAT? WHY?‚Äù for us. Most probably they are trying to follow western countries where steaks are not served with any sauces (I‚Äôm not fully sure though) but then again, It‚Äôs Bangladesh MAN! Our appetite is different, isn‚Äôt it? So, I ate the steak with lots of crushed black paper. This is how I satisfied my cravings for the sauces. If I compare it with the Woodhouse grill then I would prefer woodhouse grill. Because they give 300g of steak but at The Pit Grill they give 250g of the same cut whereas price is much higher at The Pit Grill. Woodhouse grill costs 1245 for rib eye which is 300g in weight and they charge 7% extra service charge on top of the price. Whereas The Pit Gril‚Äôs Rib Eye costs 1500 tk for 250g and they charge 10% extra as service charge. So, basically altogether the price of ribeye steak at woodhouse grill will be 1531 TK and in Pit Grill it‚Äôs 1897 TK. That‚Äôs 366 TK higher in price with less amount of meat with no sauces! Overall I‚Äôll give it 7/10 compared with the price and the quantity and quality. One important thing I want to mention is that they offer aged Steaks, which I would like to try. So, I will visit there again for that purpose but not for this rib eye steak. Ah!

20-12-18,1:55:42,840,569,71,20,119,9,48,3,1,0,"Nandos, A food heaven for us! So, Let us show you, how we eat our food at Nando‚Äôs. YouTube: https://youtu.be/ClgyiFKYPWs:=:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClgyiFKYPWs&feature=youtu.be Nando‚Äôs is well known for its unique flavour and is an international food chain. Mainly it serves Portuguese-Style various Peri Peri flavoured chicken. Maximum time we order Peri Peri Half Chicken, Cataplana Algarve & Chicken Liver. Those of you already had their food, you find it unique on its own flavour and can‚Äôt be compared with other restaurants. But still I‚Äôll try to explain how the food tastes. Cataplana Algarve - 8.5/10:=:http://8.5/10 (850+ TK) is a bowl comes with spicy rice, tender peri peri chicken, capsicum & beans all together mixed with peri peri sauce. This is one of the tasty food of Nando‚Äôs. It has a unique taste and when you take a bite mixing all the things up, then it will give you a hard punch. Peri Peri Chicken - 8.5/10:=:http://8.5/10 (735+ TK) is very tender and the peri peri sauce is what makes this chicken so amazing. Definitely try this one. Chicken Livers - 8.5/10:=:http://8.5/10 (265+ TK) is an appetizer comes with Portuguese Roll. The most amazing part of this livers is its sauces. It has some smokey flavour and feels like this flavour kinda blends into the sauce. We actually eat our chicken with the sauce comes with the chicken livers. So, if you want to have maximum taste out of Nando‚Äôs, then ask them to bring all things together into your table. Otherwise, they will serve you the chicken livers first and then the other things. I agree that the price of Nando‚Äôs is really high but to me it really worth it. You also might not like the taste of Nando‚Äôs if you eat for the first time but if you continue to go there for 2-3 times, it will make you one kind of addiction. A Peri Peri Addiction that you don‚Äôt wanna miss. After Nando‚Äôs we went to the Cold Stone for ice-cream. We mixed Strawberry and Cheesecake flavour. It was really nice and smooth. The price was 489 TK. By the way, please make sure to visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel because we frequently upload vlogs there.

Certainly, the beef patty's size is big and it's approx 180g in weight and it also got 2 cheese slice. But this is not the juiciest burger in the universe. YouTube: http://bit.ly/2Rcm4et:=:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EKlnEQlvtA&feature=youtu.be I haven't talked about this point in my VLOG so I thought I should share this in Description. You know sometimes I forget to talk on the point by seeing food in front of me. But this is why the description box is, right? Now, let's talk about a little more. Personally, I think this is one of the best burgers in town with a handsome amount of beef inside in this price range. This burger tasted good but I would say they should work on their cheese. It's so ordinary. The price of the burger is 250 TK. So, on this point they got a plus point from my perspective but this is not the juiciest burger in the universe. In fact, this is far away from the juiciest burger in the universe. I'd give it a 7/10 overall. Finally, I would say I don't have any complaint against this burger because it's so cheap and tasted good. So you can also try that out. and let me know what do you think about this burger..

YouTube: http://bit.ly/2CUX6HE:=:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTmPojJ2DV0&feature=youtu.be Every one of the items was unique of its own taste. ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶•‡ßá ‡¶Ö‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶∞ taste ‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶® ‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶≤ ‡¶õ‡¶ø‡¶≤ ‡¶®‡¶æ‡•§ Among the items, I was completely blown away by the taste of Mutton Galouti Kabab. It was made by minced Mutton mixed with some Indian herbs & spices. And when I put that into my mouth, it melted... I really can't express how awesome this was. Other items were tasty as well but this Mutton Galouti Kabab is something else. Mutton Galouti Kabab - 10/10 Bhatti Ka Chooza - 7/10 Rampuri Tali Macchi - 7.5/10:=:http://7.5/10 Laila Mojnu Sheek Kabab - 7/10 Mirch Murgh Tikka - 7/10 Factory Mahi Tikki - 6.5/10:=:http://6.5/10 Khasta Aloo Chat - 7/10 But if you want to visit here, I would highly recommend to try their buffet instead of a platter. Because the price of the buffet was 999++ whereas the price of the platter was 650++. So for only 350++ TK, you are going to get unlimited food and a lot of other menus. The platters price is not worthy compared to the price of their buffet. I'd personally give this platter a 7 because of the price but if I don't consider the price, then it will get 8.5. I'll make another vlog on their buffet. I am dying to try that with my Petuk Bou.

Indeed it is the best fish and chips, compared to the fish and co.'s fish and chips according to our tastebud. Before having this, I was not a big fan of fish and chips because of those two factors, a thick crunchy crust, and oiliness. And surprisingly, the Manhattan Fish Market's fish and chips eliminated those two factors even though they had a massive rush on their restaurant and everyone was ordering the same dish due to the discount offer. Its outer shell was also mixed with different herbs, but I think that was mostly dried parsley, which was giving an extra flavor to the dish. The tartar sauce was identical with the fish and co's tartar sauce. It was a little bit of tangy. The regular price of the fish and chips is 650+, and I'll definitely gonna have this soon. I was astonished by the taste of the soup, which was very creamy and full of minced mushroom. I don't know why, but it almost tasted like homemade Beef Nihari. We'll definitely order this soup whenever we will visit them. Now let's talk about the bad side of the same place. I'm incredibly disappointed with the platter called Grilled Gala, consists of a grilled Dory fish, four pieces of grilled prawns, a few cuts of calamari and mussels with a creamy white sauce. Among all of the items, I loved the mussels with the creamy sauce and dory fish. These two items were average in taste. But they served prawns with a red chili type sauce which tasted terrible according to our tastebud. Although the prawn was grilled to the perfection, the sauce had ruined the taste of that prawn. The calamari was tasteless as well. I'm a big fan of Fish & Co's Calamari, and the taste of this calamari was not even close to what Fish & Co. serves. The fried rice was terrible, and they served boiled vegetables with absolutely with no seasoning at all. The price of this platter was 2100+, and I'll never recommend this item to anyone.

The main taste variance in hotpot buffet are the sauces. Otherwise, everything will taste the same. But I find they don't have enough ingredient to make a lot of different sauces. I've no objection with the seafood items but they really should work on the meat items. Not a quality meat at all. It was chewy and rubbery, not soft. ‚úÖ My Personal Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8-s0x4TIDIsWB68YS4uoCA üî•üòç ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶á ‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶´‡¶ø Order ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶è‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßá ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶ï ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶®: https://www.petukcouple.com/online-store/CoolfieWalas-Malai-Kulfi-p146175866 Nikkei Location: https://goo.gl/maps/xKRhf8iFQ5vYLkHw6:=:https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nikkei/@23.7959676,90.4110973,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3755c7f1abf97eb1:0xddbe9f453a81441f!8m2!3d23.7959676!4d90.4132913?shorturl=1",https://www.facebook.com/PetukCouple/videos/406010263390271/,-4.13,petuk-couple_13,6,22,28,2019-09-08 08:38:13,sunday,9,0.9472573839662447,7,0.5714285714285714

It is similar to Thai Red Curry but richer and creamer and also has a sweetish touch to it. Today we'll be making it from scratch, and hopefully, you will like this recipe video. To make this recipe, we need to make a curry paste using Thailand's most popular ingredients like Galangal, Lemongrass & etc. And to make the curry taste more chickeny we'll include Knorr Chicken Cubes. #magicofknorrcubes",https://www.facebook.com/PetukCouple/videos/638906164500532/,-1.48,petuk-couple_177,3,26,29,2022-10-04 06:52:32,tuesday,7,0.9722912966252221,7,0.7931034482758621
